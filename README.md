# Audio-Recognition-Program

This project is the code that i used for the development of my final degree project in the UPM as an aerospace engineer. The audios that I used are gathered form a paper named AHUMADA so that running the program by yourself wonÂ´t work. If you want to do so, just change the audios in the Matrix_generation code and place the audios you want to use for getting the MFCC's. 

After you get the different dataframes with its coefficients, just run the training model with these dataframes and that's all.
